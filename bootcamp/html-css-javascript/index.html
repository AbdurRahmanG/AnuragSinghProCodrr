    <h2>Data Types</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>number</li>
            <li>string</li>
            <li>boolean</li>
            <li>undefined</li>
            <li>null</li>
            <li>bigint</li>
            <li>symbol</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Note: Null's data type is an object but in real it is not because it's null and it's treating like object because it's a bug and it did not get resolved because when this bug taken place in JavaScript after that many websites get developed in that bug only, so JavaScript developer decided that let it be and continue with this bug.</p>
